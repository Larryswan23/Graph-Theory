    "<p>Essentially the graph Isomorphism problem is whether an algorithm can detect if two graphs are the same graph but in disguise. This has proven to be reoccuring problem with special status throughtout the years in computer science. This problem holds a special status as it is one of the naturally occurring problems where it is very difficult to locate teh exact issue </p>"
